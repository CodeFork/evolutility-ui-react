# React-Evolutility

React-Evolutility provides a set of generic React Views to manage objects of different data structures. These views work together to provide full apps. With it you can quickly make web applications by configuring views with metadata instead of hand-coding Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

React-Evolutility works hand-in-hand with [Evolutility-Server](https://github.com/evoluteur/evolutility-server) which provides a matching RESTfull API based on the same metadata.

This project is a **work in progress**. I'm still learning React.
